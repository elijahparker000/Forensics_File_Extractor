# Forensics_File_Extractor

This is a project I worked on with a couple of students from my Digital Forensics class in which the goal was to extract several different file types from a provided disk image. We used information about the file signatures obtained from https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html to locate the files in the disk, and the code is able to print out information about the byte offsets of the files and extract them.
